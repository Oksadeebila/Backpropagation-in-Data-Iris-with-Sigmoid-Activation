# About the Dataset

This project utilizes a subset of the Iris dataset, focusing exclusively on two species:

- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor**

## Selected Data
We use only 20 data samples from the original dataset:

- **10 samples of Iris Setosa**
- **10 samples of Iris Versicolor**

In the target field, the classes are encoded as follows:

- **Iris Setosa** is labeled as `0`
- **Iris Versicolor** is labeled as `1`

## Data Source
The original dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

[UCI MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)

## Dataset Visualization
An image of the dataset used is provided for better understanding.
